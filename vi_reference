vi and Vim Ediotors Pocket Reference

Introduction

This poket reference is a commpainion to Learning the vi and
Vim Editors, by Arnold Robbins et al. It describes the vi com-
mand-line options, command-mode commands, ex com-
mands and options, regular experesstions and the use of the
subsititute (s) command, and other pertinent information for
using vi.

While retaining coverage of the vi clones, nvi, elvis, and
vile, this deition offers expanded coverage of the Vim editor,
which has become the de facto standard version of vi in the
GNU/Linux world.

The Solaris version of vi served as the "reference" version of
the original vi for this pocket reference.
